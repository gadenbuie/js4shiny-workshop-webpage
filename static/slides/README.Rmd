## Monday Morning — 9:00 - 10:30

### [Welcome](slides/00-hello.html) (15)

* Meet your neighbors

### [Hello WWW](slides/01-intro.html) (15)

* How does the web work?
* HTML + CSS + JS a first example
* What can we do with JS + Shiny?
* Workshop Goals

### Maiden Voyage: [How to build a website](slides/02-how-to-build-a-website.Rmd) (60)

#### Key Points

1. Overview of web development
1. The role of each language
1. Where to put HTML, CSS, JS
1. HTML 101
1. Basic CSS and JavaScript

#### Outline

* Web Dev and where R Markdown and Shiny fit in
* Anatomy of an HTML document
    * There is a `<head>`, `<body>`
    * Create a page (`first-page/index.html`)
    * **TASK** Add content to page (2)
* About HTML tags
    * Open Dev Tools
    * HTML tree: Element, node, DOM
    * HTML Tags:
        * Have open and close
        * Must be nested
        * Are block or inline
    * Block vs Inline
        * Document flow
        * Have width/height
        * div vs span
    * Common HTML Elements
        * **TASK** block or inline? (4)
        * How to find elements in Inspector
        * Common elements table
            * Try to use _semantic_ elements as much as possible
            * How to search MDN
* Classes, IDs and Attributes
    * Notice class, id, etc. in Yihui's page
    * Tags have attributes, e.g. `<a>`
    * All tags can have a `class`, an `id`, and/or `style`
        * `id`: unique identifier
        * `class`: this kind of thing
        * `style`: make this one thing look like this (use as a last resort)
        * `id` and `class` are useful when trying to _find_ or _change appearance_ of an element.
    * Examples
        * `<header class="title">`
        * `<h2 id="how-to-work-with-mathjax">`
        * `<p style="text-align: center;">`
    * **TASK** update our page
        * What parts of the page should change?
        * What parts of the page should get special treatment?
        * Add placeholder for plot
* Cascading Style Sheets
    * What and where?
    * Inside `<style>` tag in index.html
        * Set header & strong colors
        * Set background colors for target elements
            * `#` for Ids, `.class` for class
            * Use `.city` and `.age` class
        * Give chart placeholder a size
        * Set base font https://systemfontstack.com/
        * CSS variables
    * Refactor code:
        * Unique ID for each city name
* JavaScript
    * Intro to the dev console (JS bare minimum)
        * Numbers, strings, boolean
        * Addition, subtraction, division, etc.
        * `console.log()`
    * Document methods
        * Methods are functions that are attached to objects
        * The browser gives us `document`, which has
            * `document.getElementById('age')`
            * `document.querySelector('#city-header')`
        * Change age using `.textContent`
        * Change city name using `.innerHTML`
        * Changing the HTML rewrites the HTML in the browser
    * Assignment with `=`
    * Put JS in `<script>` tag at bottom of page
        * What happens if you put it at the top?
        * **TASK** Change to Los Angeles (35.9)
* How to do this using R Markdown
    * _time permitting_
    * Rewrite our first page in Rmd by moving relevant sections to `js`, `css` chunks
    * `js4shiny::html_document_plain()`
    * vs `rmarkdown::html_document()`
